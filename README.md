# KeyboardSteer for Farming Simulator 2019

## Motivation
Although I have a steering wheel, but almost always play with the keyboard. On winding roads, I am again and again landed in the ditch in front of nights or power poles.

## Description
Now I have invented this script. It varies depending on the speed, the steering speed, the return speed (autoRotateBackSpeed) and the maximum steering angle. It also turns the camera to match 
the steering angle. Both functions can also be off again, with the following keys:
* [LShift Left + Up]: Moving Camera on / off, default is on
* [LShift Left + Down]: Look backwards on / off, default is on
* [LShift Left + Space]: Shuttle control on / off, default is on
* [RShift Right + Up/Down/Left/Right]: look forward, backwards, left right
* [Space]: Change direction (aka shuttle control)

## Developer version
Please be aware you're using a developer version, which may and will contain errors, bugs, mistakes and unfinished code. 

You have been warned.

If you're still ok with this, please remember to post possible issues that you find in the developer version. 
That's the only way we can find sources of error and fix them. 
Be as specific as possible:

* tell us the version number
* only use the vehicles necessary, not 10 other ones at a time
