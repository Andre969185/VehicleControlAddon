# KeyboardSteer for Farming Simulator 2017

## Motivation
Although I have a steering wheel, but almost always play with the keyboard. On winding roads, I am again and again landed in the ditch in front of nights or power poles.

## Description
Now I have invented this script. It varies depending on the speed, the steering speed, the return speed (autoRotateBackSpeed) and the maximum steering angle. It also turns the camera to match 
the steering angle. Both functions can also be off again, with the following keys:
* ksmCAMERA [Shift Left + C]: Moving Camera on / off, default is on
* ksmENABLE [Shift Left + E]: Adaptive steering on / off, default is on
* ksmREVERSE [Shift Left + R]: Look backwards on / off, default is on
* ksmPLUS [Ctrl + E Links]: increase sensitivity
* ksmMINUS [Ctrl + C Links]: lower sensitivity
* ksmUP, ksmDOWN, ksmLEFT, ksmRIGHT [Shift Right + Cursor]: look forward, backwards, left right
