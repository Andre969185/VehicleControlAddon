# KeyboardSteer for Farming Simulator 2019

## Motivation
Although I have a steering wheel, but almost always play with the keyboard. On winding roads, I am again and again landed in the ditch in front of nights or power poles.

## Description
This script varies the steering speed depending on the speed you are driving, and it rotates the camera to match the steering angle and direction.
Shift-Left limits throttle, cruise control and maximum rounds per minute to 75%. With Shift-right and the cursor keys you can peek in the corresponding direction.
If you press Ctrl left together with W then the driving direction snaps to fixed directions.

All functions are switchable with the following default key combinations:
* Ctrl Left + C: Settings
* Ctrl Left + W: Snap Angle
* Shift Left: Throttle limiter / reduced cruise control speed
* Shift Right + Cursor: look forward, backwards, left right
* Space: Change direction (aka shuttle control)
