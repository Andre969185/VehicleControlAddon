# KeyboardSteer for Farming Simulator 2019

## Motivation
Although I have a steering wheel, but almost always play with the keyboard. On winding roads, I am again and again landed in the ditch in front of nights or power poles.

## Description
This script varies depending on the speed, the steering speed, the return speed (autoRotateBackSpeed) and the maximum steering angle. 
It also rotates the camera to match the steering the moving direction.
All functions can also be off again, with the following keys:
* Ctrl Left + C: Settings
* Ctrl Left + W: Snap Angle
* Shift Left: Throttle limiter / reduced cruise control speed
* Shift Right + Cursor: look forward, backwards, left right
* Space: Change direction (aka shuttle control)
